# ðŸ§± WebAssembly from the Ground Up

Welcome! This repo contains the code from every checkpoint in the book.

Here are some useful commands:

- `npm test` to run all tests for all checkpoints.
- `npm test <dirname>` to run all tests for a specific chapter.
  E.g., `npm test chapter01` for Chapter 1.
- `node <filename>` to run the tests in a specific checkpoint.
  E.g. `node chapter02/01-noplang.js`.
