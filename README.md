# ðŸ§± WebAssembly from the Ground Up

_(From the book [WebAssembly from the Ground Up](https://wasmgroundup.com) â€” learn Wasm by building a simple compiler in JavaScript.)_

Welcome! This repo contains the code from every checkpoint in the book.

Here are some useful commands:

- `npm test` to run all tests for all checkpoints.
- `node <filename>` to run the tests in a specific checkpoint/file.
  E.g. `node chapter02/01-noplang.js`
       `node chapter01.js`
